# Week 3 Tasks On Zuri

Week 3 tasks contains two folders for two different tasks which is divided into 
Task(a) and Task(b).

Task(a) contains details about my portfolio and its different features.

Task(b) contains a registration page, a login page and a success page. The pages are all linked together, which means that the registration page leads to the login page which futher leads to the success page, you can go back to the registration page from the success page.

I used HTML for writing my codes and i used Cascading style sheet (CSS) for styling.
